# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
For the starter template for the original project, see https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter 

To install the app:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

To run the bookstore server:
* start the development server with `npm start`

To run the tests:
* start 'npm test' in the console

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a backend server. Our store app uses a fixed token to store data on this server
If you want to restore the original store state, just change the token in BooksAPI.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
